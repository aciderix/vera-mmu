# ARET CI oracle toolchain — the closed oracle stack, baked into one image.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The ARET oracles (winediff, cpudiff, difftest, …) run against
# Wine as the ground truth. In the dev container they are provisioned at session
# start by .claude/hooks/session-start.sh; re-running that apt dance on every CI job
# would dominate the wall-clock time and depend on package availability at run time.
# Baking the exact same stack into a pinned image makes every oracle job start from a
# known, reproducible environment in seconds — and it is the structural cure for the
# shared-wineserver wedge seen in-session, because each CI job is a fresh container
# with a fresh WINEPREFIX (never cached), so there is no stale wineserver to inherit.
#
# PINNED to ubuntu:24.04 (noble) on purpose: that is the distro the measured Wine
# constants come from — wine-9.0 (Ubuntu 9.0~repack), the MODERN-theme reference the
# GUI work (KN-0112) was measured against. A newer Wine would silently move those
# constants; a REAL divergence must stay a finding, never an environment drift.
#
# This image carries ONLY the toolchain, never the repository. The workflow checks the
# repo out on top, so the image is stable and its layers cache in the registry.
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# The i386 multiarch is required by Wine (the Win32 oracle is 32-bit, like ARET's
# target) and by `gcc -m32` (the level-1/2 differential benches).
# libgd3:i386 MUST be requested explicitly and FIRST: the apt resolver otherwise
# refuses it as a transitive dep of wine's libgphoto2:i386 and the whole wine install
# aborts with "held broken packages" (observed after a container reset, 2026-08 —
# the lesson is encoded here so the image build does not re-learn it).

# Fonts are load-bearing for the GUI text oracle, not cosmetic. ARET's text path and
# Wine both substitute the Win32 faces (MS Sans Serif / Tahoma / MS Shell Dlg / Arial…)
# to the metric-compatible Liberation family via fontconfig, with DejaVu as the generic
# fallback. A bare ubuntu:24.04 ships NO fonts, so both engines fall back elsewhere and
# the ~22 text/paint winediff fixtures DIFF — an ENVIRONMENT gap, not an ARET bug (they
# pass in the dev container, which has these very packages). Installing fontconfig +
# fonts-liberation + fonts-dejavu-core makes the CI image resolve the same glyphs the
# dev container and Wine do, so the text oracle compares like for like.

# Rust via rustup (stable, minimal). Cargo.lock is format v4 and needs a current
# Cargo — the distro cargo is too old, exactly as session-start.sh notes. Installed
# into a shared location so any CI user (the job may not run as root) can use it.
